This is an implementation of a hexagonal variant of the 15-tile sliding puzzle in Haxeflixel. Project is considered complete in its current stage.

Use either the mouse controls to move tiles around, or your keyboard (up, down, left, right). Keyboard may feel strange at first, but you'll get used to it better than the mouse over time. Puzzle can be reset/shuffled from the HUD or from backspace/spacebar, respectively.

Rest assured that for all level sizes, the shuffling procedure yields all and exactly all solvable puzzles, with uniform probability distribution.

This repo may not be the best to learn from, in terms of code practice. I cobbled it together in a couple days with some over-engineered components from previous projects, and didn't bother to do a final cleaning. Nonetheless, the project should be bug-free.

Font used is HaxeFlixel default, together with [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).
